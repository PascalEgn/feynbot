"How does the 1-loop R´enyi entropy in LCFT compare to that in ordinary CFT, particularly regarding the introduction of a new primary operator and the contributions of quasiprimary operators?","In LCFT, the 1-loop R´enyi entropy differs from that in ordinary CFT due to the introduction of a new primary operator to realize the LCFT with vanishing central charge. This new primary operator, along with the existing primary operators, forms a basis where the matrix of L0 behaves like a Jordan cell, indicating the need to include pseudo-operators to complete the set. Consequently, the correlation functions in LCFT involve logarithmic terms, unlike in ordinary CFT where they do not. Additionally, in LCFT, the contributions of quasiprimary operators from the primary field X must be considered alongside those from the vacuum Verma module when computing the R´enyi entropy, especially in the small interval limit.",,,2024-04-23 11:59:15.862894
Can you explain the significance of the multi-particle contribution in the 1-loop thermal partition function of CTMG and its relationship to the R´enyi entropy?,"The multi-particle contribution in the 1-loop thermal partition function of CTMG is significant as it arises due to the presence of the pseudo energy tensor in the logarithmic CFT for CTMG, making it non-chiral. This contribution becomes apparent when expanding the partition function and comparing it with other expressions. In terms of the R´enyi entropy, the appearance of the multi-particle contribution beyond a certain order indicates a new avenue for studying LCFT, providing insights into the behavior of the system at higher orders and offering a different perspective on the holographic R´enyi entropy.",,,2024-04-23 12:01:20.962378
