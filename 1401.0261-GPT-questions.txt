Questions:
How does the 1-loop R´enyi entropy in LCFT compare to that in ordinary CFT, particularly regarding the introduction of a new primary operator and the contributions of quasiprimary operators?
What are the implications of the small interval expansion reaching order x^6, especially concerning possible 2-loop corrections in LCFT with c=0 and the agreement between massless gravitons and logarithmic modes?
How does the tree-level contribution to HRE differ in various 3D gravity theories compared to pure AdS3, and what challenges does this pose to the warped AdS3/CFT2 correspondence?
Can you explain the significance of the multi-particle contribution in the 1-loop thermal partition function of CTMG and its relationship to the R´enyi entropy?

Answers:
The 1-loop R´enyi entropy in LCFT introduces a new primary operator when the central charge in the holomorphic sector is vanishing, leading to contributions from quasiprimary operators. However, contributions proportional to the central charges only come from the vacuum Verma module, and subleading corrections include contributions from both the vacuum module and primary operators, up to level 6.
The reaching of order x^6 in the small interval expansion has significant implications. Firstly, in LCFT with c=0, possible 2-loop corrections emerge at this order, which is particularly interesting as naive 2-loop correction might be divergent. Secondly, differences between massless gravitons and logarithmic modes start to appear at this order, highlighting the nontrivial exact agreement between the two sides at the 1-loop level.
The tree-level contribution to HRE differs in various 3D gravity theories compared to pure AdS3 only by an overall factor, indicating that classical R´enyi entropies should differ only by this factor. This poses a challenge to the warped AdS3/CFT2 correspondence, especially concerning the implications for holographic R´enyi entropies.
The multi-particle contribution in the 1-loop thermal partition function of CTMG arises due to the presence of a pseudo energy tensor, making the logarithmic CFT non-chiral. Beyond order x^8 in the R´enyi entropy, the multi-particle contribution becomes significant, opening a new avenue for studying LCFT.
